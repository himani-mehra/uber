# 🚗 Uber Clone - Frontend

A responsive, user-friendly Uber clone built to mimic the essential features of the Uber ride-hailing app. This project showcases my skills in frontend development, implementing interactive UI components, and leveraging **Google Maps API** for location-based services.

## 🧠 Thought Process

> *“Recreating a real-world app is not just about mimicking the UI; it's about understanding the user flow and interaction.”*

Building the Uber Clone, I focused on these aspects:

- **Simplicity & User Experience:** The goal was to keep the interface simple, as Uber’s design focuses on ease of use.
- **Realistic Functionality:** Simulated features like ride requests and dynamic maps gave me a chance to demonstrate my understanding of how real apps integrate APIs.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensuring that the clone works seamlessly across all devices (mobile-first approach).
- **State Management:** Using vanilla JavaScript for state handling, avoiding heavy frameworks to keep it lightweight.
